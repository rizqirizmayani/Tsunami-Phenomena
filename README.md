# Tsunami Phenomenon in 1970 - 2020

## Background
Natural disasters are frequent occurrences. Natural disasters occur due to climatic and meteorological attacks that occur very strongly and suddenly that generate events such as blizzards, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes and others. In addition, landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions are also included in natural disasters. These events do not occur in any place, but tend to only in certain areas. These events usually occur very quickly and unexpectedly, although with advances in technology and science today can predict natural disasters that will occur. However, earthquakes, floods, tsunamis and tornadoes come suddenly (Baum et al, 2002). A Tsunami is a wave, or series of waves in a “wave train”, produced by a sudden vertical displacement of the water column. This displacement can be caused by seismic activity, explosive volcanism, landslides above or below water, asteroid impacts or certain meteorological phenomena. These waves can be generated in oceans, bays, lakes, rivers or reservior. The term tsunami comes from the Japanese language which has the meaning of Harbor (tsu) waves (nami), because such waves often develop as a resonance phenomenon in the harbor after an earthquake off the coast (Bryant, 2014).

## Problem Statement
*Tsunami events that occurred in the world in 1970 to 2020*

## Problem Explanation
- How much has the intensity of tsunamis been over the past 50 years?
- In what year did the highest intensity of tsunamis occur?
- What is the most dominant cause of the tsunami phenomenon?
- Where is the tsunami phenomenon? which country has the highest tsunami intensity?
- What happens when a tsunami occurs?
- What Magnitude and depth did the tsunami occur?
- Is there a difference in the magnitude values that occurred in 1970-2010 with the last 10 years?
